# nand2tetris
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to this repository, where I show my progress of learning the nand2tetris course. You will find three main items in this repository: A document containing the HACK chipset API, a document containing pseudocode and a folder containing all of the projects of this course. 

I am currently working on the second part of the course, so I will be completing projects 7 to 13. Only when I finish this course is when this repository is finished. 

Currently, I am completing project 7.

Look at this space for further developments.

Thank you,

AK

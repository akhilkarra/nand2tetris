# nand2tetris
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to this repository, where I show my progress of learning the nand2tetris course. You will find three main items in this repository: A document containing the HACK chipset API, a document containing pseudocode and a folder containing all of the projects of this course. 

I am currently working on the first part of the course, so I will be completing projects 0 to 6 first. Then, probably in 2018, I will complete the second part of the course. Only when I finish the course is when this repository is finished. Look at this space for further developments.

Thank you,
AK
